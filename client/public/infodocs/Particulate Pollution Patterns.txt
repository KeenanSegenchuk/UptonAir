	"These data are not always a perfect representation of reality, for instance purpleair sensors are sensitive to humidity, ",
	"so we apply a transformation to the PM_2.5 and humidity readings to make them correlate better with more advanced EPA sensors. ",
	"Most data you encounter in the real world has some transformation applied to it; even the 'raw data' we pull from the purpleair API is the average concentration the air monitor observed over a ten-minute period. ",
	"We can see on the images below that this transformation occasionally produces slightly negative particulate concentrations, ",
	"which is not physically possible. The following images also show how your perception of the data becomes more detailed as the sampling frequency increases. ",
	"However, with a more detailed perception, it becomes harder to distinguish random impulses from cycles and trends. "
