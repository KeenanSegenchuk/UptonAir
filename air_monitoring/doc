"pull" and "clean" don't take any input args, "get" takes a string in the format "(int) (days/weeks/months/years)"
  
"pull" pulls 2 weeks of data from the API and writes it to data.txt
"clean" sorts those data by time and removes duplicates
"get" takes a string like "10 days" and would, in that case, return the last 10 days of data from data.txt
