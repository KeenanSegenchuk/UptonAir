# Upton Air Quality Management
## Overview
This repository contains data from Air Quality sensors in Upton, Massachusetts. We currently have 10 sensors up and running and will use this website to display their data. The server and client both have their own READMEs so go check those out.

Here's what I've got so far:

By default the webpage shows the average for all the sensors in the town, but you can select one on the map to view its data. The bar graph and summary data corresponds to the sensor listed at the top of the right side of the page, but you can graph the data from multiple sensors using the Line Graph as shown below:

There's also some more explicatory info if you scroll down. This info is defined in /client/public/infodocs.
